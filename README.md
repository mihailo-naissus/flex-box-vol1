Flexbox Layout
This code provides styles for a simple flexbox layout.
Body

The body element has a dark grey background color and a large font size.

Flexbox Container
The .flexbox-container class has a yellow background color and is set to display as a flex container.

Flexbox Items
The .flexbox-item class sets a width, margin, border, and beige background color for flex items. The .flexbox-item-1, .flexbox-item-2, and .flexbox-item-3 classes set a minimum height for their respective flex items.

Potential Improvements
Consider using a CSS preprocessor, such as Sass, to better organize and maintain the styles.
Use more descriptive class names to improve code readability.
Add comments to the code to provide more context and make it easier for others to understand and work with.
